# SpaceY
Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

In this project, I will work for a new fictional space company, Space Y. My job is to determine the price of each launch, gather information about Space X, and create dashboards for your team. I will also determine if SpaceY will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceY will reuse the first stage.
